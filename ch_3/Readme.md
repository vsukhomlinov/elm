## Challenge No. 3 

Write a program that fills the screen with small blue circles, produced (pseudo) randomly and over time (choose how much time to wait between generating a new circle).

Add two new abilities:
 
- when the 'P' key on the keyboard is pressed, pause the generation of new circles and when pressed again, resume.
- when the 'R' key on the keyboard is pressed, reset and start the animation from the beginning.

Extra: try to add two buttons which will do the same things as 'P' and 'R'.
